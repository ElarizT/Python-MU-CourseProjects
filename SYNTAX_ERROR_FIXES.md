# Syntax Error Fixes for app.py

## Issue Summary
We identified and fixed two syntax errors in app.py that were preventing the application from starting in production on Render.com:

1. **First Syntax Error (Line 4465)**
   - Missing line break between consecutive statements:
   ```python
   resp = redirect(url_for('index'))    resp.delete_cookie(app.config.get('SESSION_COOKIE_NAME'))
   ```
   - This was causing a SyntaxError when running the application.

2. **Second Syntax Error (Line 4740)**
   - Missing line break between response header assignments:
   ```python
   response.headers['Expires'] = '0'    response.headers['X-Firebase-Reset'] = 'true'
   ```
   - This was causing an additional SyntaxError in the application.

## Fixes Applied
1. Added proper line breaks in both locations:
   ```python
   # First fix (line 4465)
   resp = redirect(url_for('index'))
   resp.delete_cookie(app.config.get('SESSION_COOKIE_NAME'))
   
   # Second fix (line 4740)
   response.headers['Expires'] = '0'
   response.headers['X-Firebase-Reset'] = 'true'
   ```

2. Created multiple fix scripts for different purposes:
   - `fix_syntax_errors.py` - Fixes all syntax errors
   - `fix_header_syntax.py` - Fixes just the header syntax error
   - `fix_app_py_complete.py` - Comprehensive fix for all issues including the duplicate route

3. Updated documentation in `DUPLICATE_ROUTE_FIX.md`

## Testing
- Created a `test_app_syntax.py` script that verifies the syntax is correct
- The test confirms that all syntax errors have been fixed

## Additional Notes
- While fixing the syntax errors, we also discovered another issue with duplicate route definitions for `check_session`
- This is separate from the syntax errors we fixed and would need to be addressed separately if needed

## Deployment
To deploy these fixes to production:
1. Apply the syntax error fixes using one of the provided scripts
2. Run the `test_app_syntax.py` script to verify the syntax is correct
3. Commit and push the changes to the repository
4. Deploy the updated code to Render.com
