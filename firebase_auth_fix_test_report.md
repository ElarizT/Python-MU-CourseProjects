# Firebase Logout Fix Test Report

## Test Summary
This document summarizes the results of testing the Firebase logout fix implemented in the loading-manager.js file.

## Issue Description
When a user logs out, the application was experiencing an error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'appendChild')
at createLoadingOverlay (loading-manager.js:61:19)
```

This occurred because after logout, the loading manager was still trying to create UI elements when there was no document body available or when the user had explicitly logged out.

## Fix Implemented
The loading-manager.js file was modified to:
1. Add a helper function to check for explicit logout state
2. Add checks to prevent loading overlay creation when logged out
3. Improve error handling to prevent null reference exceptions
4. Add early returns in functions when explicit logout is detected

## Test Procedure
1. Set the explicitly_logged_out flag in localStorage and sessionStorage
2. Try to use the LoadingManager to show a loading overlay
3. Verify that no overlay is created and no errors occur
