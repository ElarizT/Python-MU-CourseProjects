# File Caching Issue Fix: Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document provides a guide on implementing the solution to the file caching issue where previously uploaded files (like `azeri_text.txt`) were being used instead of newly uploaded files (like `dataset_part1.csv`).

## The Problem

When uploading a new file (e.g., `dataset_part1.csv`), the system was incorrectly using a cached file from a previous upload (e.g., `azeri_text.txt`). This behavior prevented users from successfully working with their newly uploaded files.

## The Solution

We've implemented the following features in `file_optimizer.py` to solve this issue:

1. **Session File Management**: Clear cached files before processing new uploads
2. **File Validation**: Validate that uploaded files are properly formatted CSVs
3. **Upload Management**: Properly handle file uploads and session tracking

## Implementation Steps

To implement this solution in your application, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Initialize Session Directory

At the beginning of your file processing code, ensure the session directory exists:

```python
from file_optimizer import SESSION_FILES_DIR

# Create session directory if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists(SESSION_FILES_DIR):
    os.makedirs(SESSION_FILES_DIR)
```

### Step 2: Clear Previous Session Files

Before processing a new file upload, clear any cached files:

```python
from file_optimizer import clear_session_files

# Clear any cached files from previous sessions
clear_session_files()
```

### Step 3: Process the Uploaded File

When a file is uploaded, process it using the new `manage_uploaded_file` function:

```python
from file_optimizer import manage_uploaded_file

# When a file is uploaded
def handle_file_upload(uploaded_file, filename):
    # Process the upload
    upload_result = manage_uploaded_file(uploaded_file, filename, clear_previous=True)
    
    if upload_result["status"] == "success":
        # File was uploaded successfully
        file_path = upload_result["file_path"]
        
        # Now you can process the file with read_csv_optimized
        # ...
    else:
        # Handle upload error
        error_message = upload_result["message"]
        # ...
```

### Step 4: Validate and Read the File

When reading the file, use the new validation features:

```python
from file_optimizer import read_csv_optimized

# Read and validate the file
content, metadata, is_truncated, full_size = read_csv_optimized(
    file_path,
    validate_first=True  # Add validation
)

# Check for errors
if "error" in metadata:
    # Handle error
    error_message = metadata["error"]
    # ...
else:
    # Process the content
    # ...
```

## Example Integration

Here's a complete example of integrating these functions into a file upload route:

```python
@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return jsonify({'error': 'No file part'}), 400
    
    file = request.files['file']
    
    if file.filename == '':
        return jsonify({'error': 'No selected file'}), 400
    
    # Process the uploaded file
    upload_result = manage_uploaded_file(
        file.read(),
        filename=file.filename,
        clear_previous=True  # Clear any old cached files
    )
    
    if upload_result["status"] != "success":
        return jsonify({'error': upload_result["message"]}), 400
    
    # Read and process the file
    content, metadata, is_truncated, full_size = read_csv_optimized(
        upload_result["file_path"],
        validate_first=True
    )
    
    if "error" in metadata:
        return jsonify({'error': metadata["error"]}), 400
    
    # Return the processed content
    return jsonify({
        'content': content,
        'metadata': metadata,
        'is_truncated': is_truncated,
        'size': full_size
    })
```

## Testing

Run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:

```
python test_file_optimizer.py
```

You can also use the demo script to see the solution in action:

```
python demo_fix_file_caching.py
```

## Conclusion

This solution fixes the file caching issue by properly managing uploaded files and clearing previous session files. It also adds validation to ensure that only properly formatted CSV files are processed.
