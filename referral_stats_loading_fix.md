# Referral Stats Loading Fix

## Problem Description

The settings modal in the LightYearAI application is experiencing an issue when loading referral statistics. The error message indicates that the JavaScript code is trying to parse HTML content as JSON, which suggests one of the following issues:

1. The user is not properly authenticated when the request is made
2. The server is returning an HTML error page instead of JSON data
3. There's an exception in the server-side code that handles the `/api/referral/stats` endpoint

The specific error is: `Unexpected token '<', '<!DOCTYPE'...` which indicates that HTML content is being returned when JSON is expected.

## Solution

The fix involves two parts:

### 1. Client-side Fix (JavaScript)

We've enhanced the error handling in the `settings-modal.js` file to:

- Parse the response as text first, then attempt to convert to JSON
- Handle non-JSON responses gracefully
- Add better logging for debugging purposes
- Prevent client-side JavaScript errors from breaking the application

The modified code is in `settings-modal-fixed.js`.

### 2. Server-side Fix (Python)

We've improved the `/api/referral/stats` endpoint in `app.py` to:

- Add proper exception handling
- Check for valid user authentication
- Return valid JSON even in error cases
- Add more detailed logging for debugging

The modified endpoint code is also available separately in `referral_stats_endpoint.py`.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Replace `static/js/settings-modal.js` with `static/js/settings-modal-fixed.js`
2. Update the `/api/referral/stats` endpoint in `app.py` with our improved version

## Testing

After deployment, you can verify the fix by:

1. Opening the settings modal (click the gear icon)
2. Check if the referral statistics load correctly
3. If there are still issues, check the browser console and server logs for more detailed error messages

## Additional Diagnostics

If problems persist, here are some additional steps to diagnose the issue:

### Check Authentication

Make sure the user is properly authenticated when making the request. You can verify this by:

```python
@app.route('/api/auth/check')
def check_auth():
    return jsonify({
        'authenticated': 'user_id' in session,
        'user_id': session.get('user_id', None)
    })
```

### Check Firestore Connection

Verify that the Firestore database connection is working properly:

```python
@app.route('/api/firestore/check')
@login_required
def check_firestore():
    try:
        from firebase_admin import firestore
        db = firestore.client()
        server_timestamp = db.collection('diagnostics').document('timestamp').get()
        return jsonify({
            'connected': True,
            'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
        })
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({
            'connected': False,
            'error': str(e)
        })
```
