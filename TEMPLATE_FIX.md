# Template Syntax Fix for LightYearAI

## Problem Description

There was a template syntax error in the `index.html` file that caused a Jinja2 exception:

```
jinja2.exceptions.TemplateSyntaxError: Encountered unknown tag 'endblock'.
```

This was caused by having multiple `{% endblock %}` tags without corresponding `{% block %}` tags.

## The Fix

The issue has been fixed by:

1. Moving all CSS styles from the template file to the CSS file
2. Organizing the template structure properly with matching block/endblock tags

## Local Testing

You can verify the template fix locally:

```bash
# Run the Python script to check and fix template syntax
python fix_template.py
```

This script will:
- Validate the template syntax
- Fix any issues if found
- Provide a clear output of what was done

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Manual Deployment with Fix

1. Run the Python script to check the template is fixed
2. Deploy the application normally

### Option 2: Automated Fix During Deployment 

We've updated two files to automatically fix the template during deployment:

1. `Procfile`: Now runs the fix script before starting the app
2. `render.yaml`: Updated to include the fix script in the build/start commands

### Option 3: Quick Fix in Production

If the app is already deployed and experiencing issues, you can SSH into the server and run:

```bash
python fix_template.py
```

This will automatically detect and fix any template syntax issues.

## Summary of Changes

1. Fixed the template syntax error in `index.html`
2. Created `index_fixed.html` as a backup clean version
3. Added Python script `fix_template.py` for automated checking and fixing
4. Updated deployment configurations in `Procfile` and `render.yaml` to run the fix before starting the app

## How to Test Your Fix

After deployment, you can verify the fix by:

1. Accessing the landing page (/)
2. Checking the browser's developer console for errors
3. Examining the server logs for any Jinja2 exceptions
