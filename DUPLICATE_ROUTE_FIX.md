# Firebase Authentication Logout Route Fix

## Issue Summary
The application failed to start in production due to several errors:

1. A duplicate Flask route definition for `/logout_cleanup` causing this error:
   ```
   AssertionError: View function mapping is overwriting an existing endpoint function: logout_cleanup
   ```

2. Syntax errors in the app.py file due to missing line breaks:
   - First issue:
   ```
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax
   File "/opt/render/project/src/app.py", line 4465
   resp = redirect(url_for('index'))    resp.delete_cookie(app.config.get('SESSION_COOKIE_NAME'))
                                      ^^^^
   ```
   
   - Second issue:
   ```
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax
   File "/opt/render/project/src/app.py", line 4740
   response.headers['Expires'] = '0'    response.headers['X-Firebase-Reset'] = 'true'
                                      ^^^^
   ```

These errors occurred because:
1. We had two separate route definitions with the same URL path and the same function name in app.py
2. There were missing line breaks between consecutive statements in two different locations

## Changes Made
1. Removed the duplicate route definition and implementation for `/logout_cleanup`
2. Fixed syntax errors by adding line breaks in two locations:
   - Between redirect creation and cookie deletion (around line 4465)
   - Between response header assignments (around line 4740)
3. Added comments to clarify that the `/logout_cleanup` route is defined elsewhere in the file
4. Created fix scripts that can be applied to the production environment

## How to Apply the Fix
You can apply the fix using one of the provided scripts:

### For Linux/Mac:
```bash
bash fix_duplicate_route.sh
```

### For Windows:
```powershell
.\fix_duplicate_route.ps1
```

### Using the Comprehensive Fix Script:
```bash
# For Linux/Mac
python fix_app_py_complete.py

# For Windows
python .\fix_app_py_complete.py
```

### Using Individual Fix Scripts:
```bash
# For the first syntax error (Linux/Mac)
python fix_syntax_error.py

# For the second syntax error (Linux/Mac)
python fix_header_syntax.py

# For Windows
python .\fix_syntax_errors.py
python .\fix_header_syntax.py
```

Alternatively, you can manually edit app.py to:
1. Remove the duplicate route definition and implementation for `/logout_cleanup` (around line 4748)
2. Fix the syntax error by adding a line break between `resp = redirect(url_for('index'))` and `resp.delete_cookie(app.config.get('SESSION_COOKIE_NAME'))` (around line 4465)
3. Fix the syntax error by adding a line break between `response.headers['Expires'] = '0'` and `response.headers['X-Firebase-Reset'] = 'true'` (around line 4740)

## Testing
After applying the fix:
1. Test the application locally to ensure it starts without errors
2. Test the `/logout` route to ensure it still works correctly
3. Test the `/logout_cleanup` route to ensure it still works correctly

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Use unique function names for different routes
2. Consider organizing related routes into Blueprint modules
3. Add comments to mark the locations of important routes
4. Run code through a linter to catch syntax errors before deployment
5. Implement automated testing to catch route conflicts before deployment
