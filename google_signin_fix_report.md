- Enhanced session management and token verification
- Added detailed logging for token verification process
- **NEW FIX: Added flash message support for login failures**

### 4. Client-Side Stability

- Added popup blocker detection
- Implemented automatic authentication state checking
- Created visual feedback for sign-in process
- **NEW FIX: Added comprehensive logging in the processRedirectResult function**

### 5. Mobile Compatibility

- Ensured mobile devices use redirect authentication method
- Improved responsive design for authentication forms
- **NEW FIX: Enhanced redirect handling for better mobile support**

### 6. Diagnostic Tools

- Created Firebase configuration verification script
- Added admin endpoint to check Firebase settings
- Implemented client-side tools to debug authentication state
- **NEW FIX: Added detailed session diagnostics and authentication flow logging**
- **NEW FIX: Created a "Test Google Auth" button in the troubleshooting section to directly verify authentication**
- **NEW FIX: Added browser compatibility checker to identify potential environment issues**
- **NEW FIX: Implemented more detailed error reporting with specific error codes and messages**

## Files Changed

1. Login/Signup Templates:
   - Updated Firebase SDK version
   - Improved error handling
   - Added visual feedback during authentication
   - **NEW FIX: Added flash message support**
   - **NEW FIX: Fixed syntax error in Firebase SDK imports**
   - **NEW FIX: Improved popup window testing and fallback mechanism**

2. JavaScript Helpers:
   - Created shared authentication functions
   - Added debugging tools
   - Implemented authentication state monitoring
   - **NEW FIX: Changed redirect result handling to use POST request**
   - **NEW FIX: Completely rewrote firebase-redirect-handler.js to be compatible with Firebase v9 API**
   - **NEW FIX: Enhanced error handling with specific error codes and user-friendly messages**

3. Server-Side Logic:
   - Centralized authentication code
   - Improved error logging
   - Enhanced session management
   - **NEW FIX: Updated the `google_login` route to properly handle authentication status**

## Testing Procedure

To verify the fix works properly:

1. Test Google Sign-In on desktop using Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
2. Test on mobile devices
3. Test with popup blockers enabled
4. Verify authentication persistence works correctly
5. Confirm proper error handling for invalid tokens
6. **NEW: Use the "Test Google Auth" button in the troubleshooting section to directly test authentication**
7. **NEW: Verify that the updated redirect handler works properly when popups are blocked**
8. **NEW: Test session timeout scenarios and automatic refresh**

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify Firebase configuration in the `.env` file
3. Run `/api/debug/firebase` endpoint (admin only)
4. Check server logs for detailed authentication errors
5. **NEW: Examine the enhanced authentication logs for any specific error points**

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a fully client-side Firebase auth flow
2. Add more authentication methods (Apple, Microsoft, etc.)
3. Implement authentication state synchronization between tabs
