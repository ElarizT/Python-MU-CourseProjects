# Deployment Fix for Template Syntax Error

## Quick Deployment Steps

1. **Pull the latest code** with the fix
2. **Deploy to Render** as usual - the automated fix will run before the app starts

## What Was Fixed

The `index.html` template had a Jinja2 syntax error:
```
jinja2.exceptions.TemplateSyntaxError: Encountered unknown tag 'endblock'.
```

This was caused by:
- CSS styles embedded directly in the template file
- Multiple `{% endblock %}` tags without matching `{% block %}` tags

## How We Fixed It

1. **Moved all CSS to external file**:
   - Extracted all inline styles to `landing-page.css`

2. **Fixed template structure**:
   - Ensured all blocks have matching opening and closing tags
   - Created a clean backup template at `index_fixed.html`

3. **Added automated fix**:
   - Created `fix_template.py` to validate and fix template issues
   - Updated deployment configs to run this script at startup

## Verification

After deploying, check:
1. The landing page loads without errors
2. No Jinja2 exceptions in the logs
3. Styling is correctly applied

## Manual Fix (If Needed)

If issues persist after deployment, you can SSH into the server and run:

```bash
cd /opt/render/project/src
python fix_template.py
```

This will automatically detect and fix any template issues.
